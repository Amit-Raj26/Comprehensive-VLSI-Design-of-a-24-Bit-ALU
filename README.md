# Comprehensive-VLSI-Design-of-a-24-Bit-ALU
Complete VLSI Design of a 24-bit ALU: This project covers the full VLSI design flow, from RTL coding in Verilog to physical layout. It includes synthesis, custom cell library creation, energy-delay optimization, and physical design using Cadence tools, culminating in static timing analysis.
